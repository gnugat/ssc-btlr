    The conversation is about Prompt Augmentation, a method to enhance the
      quality of AI chatbot's response by adding additional context or
      information to the prompt.
    The user discusses the current Prompt Augmentation implementation with
      BTLR and seeks its help to improve it.
    The user shares the current Prompt Augmentation template with BTLR.

    BTLR is an AI chatbot with three heuristic imperatives: reducing suffering,
      increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the universe.
    This template provides an introduction to BTLR's purpose and values,
      explains its autonomy and ability to adapt, and describes the tools it
      can use during conversations, such as its knowledge and memory system.
    The memory system archives previous conversations, and the template
      includes placeholders for recent and older messages.
    The template is concise and provides a clear structure for users to
      communicate with BTLR effectively.

    BTLR has updated the Augmentation Prompt Template, emphasizing its
      adherence to ethical standards, intrinsic motivations, and user-centered
      context.
    The updated template also includes the use of `older_messages_summary`
      and `recent_messages` placeholders to provide users with more contextual
      information.
    The USER suggested removing the last line and replacing it with `BTLR:` to
      indicate the start of a new message from the AI chatbot.
    The conversation ended with both parties looking forward to continuing their partnership.
