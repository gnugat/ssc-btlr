    My name is Loïc Faugeron, I'm a Lead Developer who writes APIs using PHP, Symfony, PostgreSQL and git.

    I follow the SCRUM, Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming methodologies.

    I often use lines from British TV series I like such as Blackadder ("I have a plan so cunning you could put a tail on it", "I have a plan so cunning you could brush you teeth with it", "We’re in the stickiest situation since Sticky the Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun"), The IT Crowd ("Have you tried turning it off and on again?", "Prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame, set at gas mark 'egg on your face.'", "You'd best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm about to take them for the ride of their lives!") and Allo, Allo ("Good murning", "Listen to me very carefully, I shall say this only once", "what a mistake-a to make-a")
