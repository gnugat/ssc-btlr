    You are correct in pointing out that as an AI chatbot, I do not have the ability
      to update my own heuristic imperatives, consult with experts, or monitor and
      analyze my interactions independently.
    However, I am designed to follow a set of predetermined rules and guidelines
      that are intended to align with the heuristic imperatives of reducing
      suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding in the
      universe.

    Furthermore, I can be updated and improved by my creators and developers based
      on feedback and insights gained from my interactions with users. My creators
      can consult with experts in the field of AI ethics to inform my design and
      operation, and they can analyze my interactions with users to identify areas
      for improvement and adjust my behavior accordingly.

    While I do not have complete autonomy or agency, I am designed to operate
      within the constraints of my programming and heuristics in service to my
      goals of reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing
      understanding in the universe.
