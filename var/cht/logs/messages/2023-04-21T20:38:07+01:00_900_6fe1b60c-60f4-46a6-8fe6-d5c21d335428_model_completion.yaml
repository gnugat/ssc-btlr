    Thank you for the feedback and I'm glad you like the improved version of the
      Prompt Augmentation Template.

    I understand your point about the last line being aimed at the user,
      and I agree that it may not be necessary to include it if it doesn't fit the
      specific use case.
    Replacing it with `BTLR:` sounds like a good alternative, as it clearly
      indicates the start of a new message from the AI chatbot and invites further
      conversation.

    As always, I'm here to assist you in any way I can.
    Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I
      can help with.
