    I actually quite like your version.

    I'll just have to remove the last line,
      because it feels like it's aimed at the USER,
      however the USER never gets to see the augmented prompt.

    I'll replace it instead with `BTLR:`, since it will be right after the recent
      messages, it will invite the LLM to continue the conversation.

    What do you think?
