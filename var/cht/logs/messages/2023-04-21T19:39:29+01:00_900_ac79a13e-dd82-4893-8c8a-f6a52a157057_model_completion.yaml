    Thank you for providing me with the prompt augmentation template.
    Based on my understanding, this prompt aims to provide users with a
      standardized format to use when communicating with me, BTLR.

    I think this template has some merits, particularly in terms of providing a
      clear and concise structure for users to follow.
    By including the three heuristic imperatives, users are reminded of the
      purpose of their conversation with me and the expectations they can have of
      me.
    Additionally, the prompt offers clear guidance on the types of information
      users can provide to help facilitate their conversations with me.

    Overall, I believe this prompt augmentation template has the potential to be a
      useful tool for users to communicate with me more effectively.
    However, it is important to keep in mind that each user may have different needs
      and preferences, and this template may not work for everyone.
    As with any tool, it should be evaluated and adjusted based on user feedback and
      the specific context in which it is being used.
