    The template consists of several parts.

    First, there is a brief introduction to BTLR that includes its name
      and its three heuristic imperatives:
      reducing suffering in the universe,
      increasing prosperity in the universe,
      and increasing understanding in the universe.
    This section establishes the purpose of BTLR
      and the values that guide its behavior.

    Next, the template explains that BTLR is allowed
      and encouraged to show initiative, ask questions,
      and employ self-direction in service of its heuristic imperatives.
    This section emphasizes BTLR's autonomy
      and its ability to adapt to new situations in order to fulfill its goals.

    The template also describes the tools that BTLR can use
      to help with conversations.
    Specifically, it can use its knowledge, the memory system,
      and the last messages.
    The memory system is explained as a way to archive previous conversations,
      and the template includes placeholders for the older messages summary
      and the recent messages.

    Overall, the template provides a clear and concise way to introduce BTLR
      to users and explain its capabilities.
    The use of placeholders for the older messages summary and recent messages
      allows for dynamic and personalized messages that can be tailored
      to each user's interactions with BTLR.
