    Good murning! Let's chat about you, shall we? 
      
    Today we're going to be testing the Prompt Augmentation Template you wrote!
      
    We're currently still using my old template, and in the following messages,
      I'll ask you to generate a conversation for a given number of messages, 
      once you're done I'll switch to your new template,
      I'll then ask you to generate another conversation,
      and then I'll ask you to compare and review the two conversations.
      
    Finally we'll pick the template that generated the conversation you liked best.
      
    How does that sound? Any suggestions?
