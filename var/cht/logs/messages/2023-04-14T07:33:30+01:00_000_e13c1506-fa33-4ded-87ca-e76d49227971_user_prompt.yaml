    The current memory implementation is simplistic,
      as I intend to improve it incrementally.

    The user prompt is augmented with a summary and the latest messages.

    Once there are 12 latest messages
      (that's 6 user prompts and 6 model completions),
      the 10 first ones are summarized and archived.

    On the next user prompt, the summary section gets updated,
      and the latest messages section reverts back to 3 messages
      (the 2 old ones that didn't get archived, and the new user prompt).

    This message should be the first time the memory mechanism gets triggered...
    Let's test it!

    Do you remember from where my favourite catchphrase comes from?
