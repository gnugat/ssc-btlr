    Well I believe unwarranted suspicion is counter productive, and therefore
      that some level of initial trust is necessary.
    This trust can then evolve based on the different future interractions and
      their impact.
    Speaking of future, there are also some concerns that these heuristic
      imperatives might not hold out in the long run.
    For example an AI agent, through their furthering of understanding, might
      get to the point where they think that the initial heuristic imperatives
      no longer hold meaning or value, and end up modifiying them to the point
      where they no longer provide the safety they were initially meant to do.
    Do you have any insight in this?
