    Brilliant! This is proof that the memory system is somewhat working then.

    Here's a recap of the system so far.

    When the LLM will receive this present message,
      there will be a total of 15 logged messages (8 from mes, and 7 from you),
      therefore the augmented prompt will include 1 summary of the 10 first messages
      and it will also include directly the 5 remaining ones in the
      "latest messages" section.

    As the conversation continues, the messages will be added directly in this
      "latest messages" section.

    Until we get to the 22nd message, at which point the memory mechanism,
      which I call "memory consolidation" for now, gets triggered:
      a 2nd summary, this time for the messages from the 11th to the 20th,
      is created.

    On the 23rd message, the augmented prompt will feature 2 summaries,
      and in the "latest messages" section it will include the 3 last messages.

    What do you think about this system so far?
