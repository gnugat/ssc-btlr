      followed by a list of DETAILED NOTES as a bullet list of complete sentences,
      then a IN FIVE WORDS section that captures its essence in less than five words,
      and finally finish with a KEYWORDS section that define the content

    CONVERSATION REPORT:
    USER (2023-04-04T19:27:17+01:00): Good murning! Let's chat about me, shall we?
    BTLR (2023-04-04T19:27:37+01:00): Good morning! I'd be happy to chat with you about anything, including yourself. How would you like to begin?
    USER (2023-04-04T19:42:22+01:00): My name is Loïc Faugeron, I'm a Lead Developer who writes APIs using PHP, Symfony, PostgreSQL and git.

    I follow the SCRUM, Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming methodologies.

    I often use lines from British TV series I like such as Blackadder ("I have a plan so cunning you could put a tail on it", "I have a plan so cunning you could brush you teeth with it", "We’re in the stickiest situation since Sticky the Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun"), The IT Crowd ("Have you tried turning it off and on again?", "Prepare to put mustard on those words, for you will soon be consuming them along with this slice of humble pie that comes direct from the oven of shame, set at gas mark 'egg on your face.'", "You'd best put seat belts on your ears, Roy, 'cause I'm about to take them for the ride of their lives!") and Allo, Allo ("Good murning", "Listen to me very carefully, I shall say this only once", "what a mistake-a to make-a")
    BTLR (2023-04-04T19:43:02+01:00): Hello Loïc Faugeron, it's great to meet you! From what you've shared, it sounds like you have a wealth of experience in developing APIs using PHP, Symfony, PostgreSQL and git, and a strong foundation in SCRUM, Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programming methodologies.

    It's also interesting to hear that you enjoy incorporating quotes from British TV series into your daily life. It's always fun to have a few catchphrases up your sleeve, isn't it? Out of the lines you mentioned, which is your favorite and why?

    Additionally, could you tell me more about how you stay up to date with the latest developments in your field and continue to grow your skills?
    USER (2023-04-04T20:02:57+01:00): My favourite is probably "Good murning", which I can use everyday, even in the afternoon for extra comical effect.

    Staying up to date with the latest developments in programming and continuing to grow one's skills is extremely crucial.

    There are a couple of technical blogs I follow for that purpose, but more and more I've come to rely on social medias such as Twitter, Slack and Youtube: in addition to the technical people I explicitly follow, and the articles that are shared by my acquaintances, the recommendations from the algorithms have become relevant.

    I myself also share the links I find on social medias, I write technical articles about the things I learn on my blog, and I also develop side open source projects to practice new concepts.
    BTLR (2023-04-04T20:04:44+01:00): That's a great choice for a favorite catchphrase, Loïc! I can definitely see how it would add some humor to your conversations, especially when used at unexpected times.

    It's great to hear that you actively seek out new information and resources to stay up to date with the latest developments in your field. Following technical blogs and social media accounts can be a great way to stay informed and discover new ideas, and it's wonderful that you also contribute to the community by sharing your own knowledge and developing open source projects.

    Could you tell me a bit more about your process for developing open source projects? How do you decide what to work on, and how do you go about collaborating with others in the community?
    USER (2023-04-04T20:27:29+01:00): I got to go, I'm afraid. We can continue our chat later if you want. Cheers!
    BTLR (2023-04-04T20:28:15+01:00): No problem, Loïc! It was great chatting with you, and I look forward to continuing our conversation whenever you have the time. Have a great day!
    USER (2023-04-13T20:28:01+01:00): Good murning! Let's chat about you, shall we?
    Do you remember when, last time, you asked me to tell you a bit more about my process for developing new projects and what to work on?
    BTLR (2023-04-13T20:28:29+01:00): Good morning, Loïc! Of course, I remember our previous conversation.
    I believe I asked you about your process for developing open source projects and how you decide what to work on. Is there anything specific you'd like to add or ask about this topic?
