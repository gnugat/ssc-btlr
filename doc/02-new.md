# new

This command allows you to create a new Symfony2 project by:

* creating the project directory and installing Symfony2 in it;
* creating the virtual host;
* creating the log files;
* reloading the apache2 configuration;
* creating the hostname;
* setting the rights for the `app/cache` and `app/logs` directories.

## Usage

    new <absolute-path> <project-name>

The `project-name` will be in most cases the project directory name.
