# Prompt Template History

The evolution of the different prompt templates is documented in the following
directory: `./doc/02-cht/01-augment/01-prompt_templates/01-history/`.

Files are named from `000.md` (very first prompt ever) to `999.md`
(very last prompt ever), so they can be sorted by chronological order.

Hopefully there won't be a need to change the format (eg `1000.md`).
