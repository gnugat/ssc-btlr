# cht:augment

Using the `--help` option, the command will print the recommended way to run it:

```
./btlr cht:augment --help
```

Copy paste the last line, and you're ready to go!

## Options

While it is recommened to use the example values given in the `--help` display,
it is possible to customize the different options.

### Manual Mode

When `--manual-mode true` is used, API calls to LLMs are disabled,
and the user is asked to:

* first copy paste the displayed prompts to their favorite LLMs (eg ChatGPT)
* then copy paste the LLM's completion back in the terminal

When given any other value (eg `--manual-mode false`, `--manual-mode 0`, etc),
then API calls to the configured, supported LLM are made.

> **Warning**: Currently no LLM API calls have been implemented,
> so only the Manual Mode will work.

### Config: LLM engine

When `--config-llm-engine "chatgpt-gpt-3.5-turbo"` is used,
[OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com/) is set as the LLM engine to use.

> **Warning**: Currently no LLM API calls have been implemented,
> so this value is only used informatively in the logs to help determine how
> messages were generated.

### Config: Last Messages Filename

To enable Infinite Memory, and to be able to determine how each messages were
generated, the following need to be persisted somewhere as log entries:

* user prompt: what the user provided
* augmented prompt: the final prompt to be given to the LLM
* model completion: what the LLM generated

When `--config-last-messages-filename ./var/cht/logs/last_messages` is used,
they are persisted locally on the filesystem at the given path.

The following filename template is used to save the log entries:

* `%last_messages_filename%/%time%_%priority%_%id%_%source%.json`

The placeholders will then be replaced with the appropriate values:

* `last_messages_filename`: with the value from the option
  (eg `./var/cht/logs/last_messages`)
* `%time%`: a time generated by the system
* `%id%`: a UUID generated by the system
* `%source%`: one of
  * `user_prompt`, its priority is `000`
  * `augmented_prompt`, its priority is `500`
  * `model_completion`, its priority is `900`
* `%priority%`: a three digit number associated with the source

The log entries are stored in chronological order to make it easier to read
(the priority bit is used to make sure that log entries are listed in logical
order, for example that the user prompt always appear before the model
completion)

### Config: Prompt Templates

The user prompt is augmented by using prompt templates.

Custom ones can be used with the following options:

* `--config-augmented-prompt-template-filename`
