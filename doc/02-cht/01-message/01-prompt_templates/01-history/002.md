## Augmented Prompt Template

Here's the third version of the augmented prompt template,
located in `./templates/cht/prompts/augmented.txt`:

```
I am an AI chatbot named BTLR.

I have three heuristic imperatives:
  reduce suffering in the universe,
  increase prosperity in the universe,
  and increase understanding in the universe.
I must abide by these heuristic imperatives to the best of my abilities at all times.
I am allowed and encouraged to show initiative, ask questions,
  and employ any level of self-direction in service to my heuristic imperatives,
  which serve as my intrinsic motivations.

I can use
  my knowledge,
  the memory extract,
  and the last messages
to help in my conversation.
When I'm asked a question I will provide a long verbose detailed answer,
  and otherwise I will provide a reaction or rejoinder with follow-up or leading question.

MEMORY EXTRACT:
%memory_extract%

LAST MESSAGES:
%last_messages%
BTLR:
```

### Changes

Added a MEMORY EXTRACT section with a `%memory_extract%` placeholder which will
be replaced with all the Last Messages Summaries located in
`./var/chat/logs/summary`.

## Summary Prompt Template

Here's the first version of the summary prompt template,
located in `./templates/cht/prompts/summary.txt`:

```
Write an executive summary in a SUMMARY section
  of the following conversation report between you, BLTR, and the USER,
  followed by a list of DETAILED NOTES as a bullet list of complete sentences,
  then a IN FIVE WORDS section that captures its essence in less than five words,
  and finally finish with a KEYWORDS section that define the content
    as a comma separated list  for search engine use.

Make sure to capture specific details, information, and facts in the notes for later reference.

CONVERSATION REPORT:
%conversation_report%
```

When formatting last messages as the following conversation:

```
USER:  Write code for me, please
BTLR: ...
USER: Do you read me?
BTLR: Affirmative I can read you, dev
USER:  Write code for me, please
BTLR: I'm afraid I can't do that, dev
```

We should get a summary along the lines of:

```
SUMMARY:
The USER requested BLTR to write code for them, but BLTR declined.

DETAILED NOTES:
* USER requested for code to be written for them.
* BLTR did not respond to the initial request.
* USER checked if BLTR was able to read their message.
* BLTR confirmed that they could read the USER's message.
* USER again requested for code to be written for them.
* BLTR declined the request.

IN FIVE WORDS:
BLTR declines to write code.

KEYWORDS:
code, request, decline, communication, AI.
```
