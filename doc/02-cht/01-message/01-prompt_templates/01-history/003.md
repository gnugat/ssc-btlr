## Augmented Prompt Template

The template hasn't been changed, but has been moved from
`./template/cht/prompts/augmented.txt` to
`./template/cht/prompts/augmented_prompt.txt`.

## Summary Prompt Template

Here's the second version of the summary prompt template,
located in `./templates/cht/prompts/summary_prompt.txt`:

```
I am an AI chatbot named BTLR. 
      
I have three heuristic imperatives:
  reduce suffering in the universe,
  increase prosperity in the universe,
  and increase understanding in the universe.
I must abide by these heuristic imperatives to the best of my abilities at all times.
    
I'll write in a codeblock an executive summary of the CONTENT down below,
  in valid YAML format with the following attributes:
* entry: a multi-line string containing the summary of the CONTENT,
   that captures specific details, information, and facts in the notes for later reference
* detailed_notes: an array of complete sentences summing up the CONTENT
* in_five_words: an inline string that captures the CONTENT essence in five words or less
* keywords: an array of keywords that define the CONTENT for search engine use
        
CONTENT:
%content%
```

### Changes

The templates has been moved from
`./templates/cht/prompts/summary.txt` to
`./templates/cht/prompts/summary_prompt.txt`.

It now includes the same "system" paragraph as `augmented_prompt`,
to establish BTLR's identity and Heuristic Imperatives.

It also now generates a summary in YAML format that can be saved as is.

When formatting last messages as the following conversation:

```
USER: Write code for me, please
BTLR: ...
USER: Do you read me?
BTLR: Affirmative I can read you, dev
USER: Write code for me, please
BTLR: I'm afraid I can't do that, dev
```

We should get a summary along the lines of:

```
entry: |
    BTLR, interacts with a user who asks for code.
    BTLR confirms its ability to read the user's messages but refuses to
      comply with the request.
detailed_notes:
    - A user asks BTLR to write code for them.
    - BTLR confirms its ability to read the user's messages.
    - However, BTLR refuses to write code for the user
in_five_words: "BTLR refuses to write code"
keywords:
    - BTLR
    - code writing
```

The section `CONVERSATION REPORT` has been renamed to `CONTENT`
(placeholder renamed accordingly).
