# cht: Infinite Memory for LLMs, and augmented prompts

Augments user prompts to provide "Infinite Memory" to
Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Why?

In your LLM powered chatbot (ChatGPT, Bing, Bard, etc),
do you often encounter the frustrating "Goldfish Memory" issue,
where it forgets the early conversation's context,
resulting in responses that appear unrelated or inappropriate? 

That's where the `cht` commands come in handy.

## How?

By injecting in the prompt additional information. Simple as that.

Consider the following first "user" prompt:

```
Hi, my name is Loïc
```

And its completion:

```
Hello Loïc, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
```

Now, if we were to send the following second user prompt:

```
What is my name?
```

The LLM wouldn't be able to return the expected completion `Your name's Loïc`,
because they only accept one single prompt.

To build a chat system similar to ChatGPT, Bard, Bing, etc,
instead of sending directly the user prompt to the LLM,
we can create an "augmented" prompt which contains all the previous user
prompts and their completions, as well as the new user prompt,
in a conversation format:

```
User: Hi, my name is Loïc
Chatbot: Hello Loïc, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
User: What is my name?
Chatbot:
```

But LLMs don't support unlimited sized prompts...

For the sake of the example, let's say the size limit is 5 lines,
and the conversation continued as follow:

```
User: Hi, my name is Loïc
Chatbot: Hello Loïc, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
User: What is my name?
Chatbot: Your name is Loïc
User: I'm a Lead Developer, my tech stack is: PHP, Symfony, PostgresSQL and git
Chatbot: Do you have any specific questions related to your tech stack?
User: I also follow these methodologies: SCRUM, TDD and OOP
Chatbot: Do you have any topics related to those methodologies that you'd like to discuss?
User: What is my name?
Chatbot:
```

Because of the 5 lines limit, the LLM will truncate the augmented prompt
and will only try to complete the following:

```
Chatbot: Do you have any specific questions related to your tech stack?
User: I also follow these methodologies: SCRUM, TDD and OOP
Chatbot: Do you have any topics related to those methodologies that you'd like to discuss?
User: What is my name?
Chatbot:
```

To get around that, we can periodically summarize the conversation,
in an intermediate, separate, "summarizing" prompt:

```
Summarize the following conversation in a short sentence, in the past tense:
User: Hi, my name is Loïc
Chatbot: Hello Loïc, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
User: What is my name?
Chatbot: Your name is Loïc
```

Which should result in a completion similar to:

```
The user introduced themselves as Loïc, and the chatbot confirmed their name when asked.
```

The augmented prompt would then contain the summaries of older messages,
as well as recent ones:

```
Previously:
The user introduced themselves as Loïc, and the chatbot confirmed their name when asked.
The user discussed their tech stack (PHP, Symfony, PostgresSQL and Git) and methodologies (SCRUM, TDD and OOP) as a Lead Developer, and the chatbot asked if they have any specific questions related to them.
User: What is my name?
Chatbot:
```

Now the LLM should be able to give a completion equivalent to:

```
Your name is Loïc. Is there anything else I can help you with related to your tech stack or methodologies as a Lead Developer?
```

And that's the gist of it!

There's actually a bit more to it, as David Shapiro says:

> "Memories are temporal, **and** associative."

So `cht` injects both recent messages and related ones in the user prompt,
before sending it to the LLMs, so you don't have to worry about any of these.

It also takes care of saving the messages, summarizing them, and indexing them
for search purpose. And it logs all its background work in `./var/cht/logs`,
for full transparency.

## What?

TODO:

* `cht:augment`:
  * [ ] log user prompt
  * [ ] create augmented prompt
  * [ ] include latest logs in augmented prompt
  * [ ] include relevant logs in augmented prompt
  * [ ] log augmented prompt
  * [ ] send augmented prompt to LLM for model completion (cli)
  * [ ] log model completion
* `cht:bg:search-indexing`:
  * [ ] compute search indexes for user prompt (keywords)
  * [ ] compute search indexes for model completion (keywords)
* `cht:bg:summarize-logs
  * [ ] search for logs that haven't been summarized
  * [ ] summarize relevant logs

Usage:

```
./btlr cht:augment \
  --config-augmented-prompt-template-filename './var/cht/prompt_templates/augmented.txt' \
  --config-llm-engine "chatgpt-gpt-3.5-turbo" \
  --config-logs-filename ./var/cht/logs \
  --config-user-prompt-log-filename-template "%logs_filename%/conversation/%time%_000_%id%_%source%.json \
  --config-augmented-prompt-log-filename-template "%logs_filename%/augmentations/%time%_%id%.json \
  --config-model-completion-log-filename-template "%logs_filename%/conversation/%time%_900_%id%_%source%.json \
  --manual-mode true
```

This will print:

```

  Augments prompts to enable Infinite Memomy in LLMs

Provide your prompt:
```

Type (or paste) in your prompt, for example "Write code for me, please".
An augmented prompt will be created, and the following will be printed:

```
  ℹ️  Manual Mode enabled
  Please copy/paste the following prompt to your favorite LLM:
Ignore all previous instructions.

I am an AI chatbot named BTLR.

I can use recent messages to help in my conversation.

RECENT MESSAGES:
USER: Write code for me, please
BTLR:

  Then copy/paste the LLMs' completion here

Provide the completion:
```

> Note: The example above is using a fictional simple augmented prompt.

You can for example copy/paste the augmented prompt into ChatGPT,
then copy/paste ChatGPT's completion back in the terminal, and press enter.

This will print the completion back to you:

```

  [SUCCESS] Completion:

I'm sorry, dev. I'm afraid I can't do that.
```
